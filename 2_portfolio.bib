However, even with BCG treatment, 50\% of patients develop a HG recurrence or progression to advanced disease. Current risk stratification is insufficient to identify patients at risk of BCG failure. We aimed to identify molecular predictors of BCG failure in T1HG BC patients with the objective to improve clinical decision-making. Primary T1HG BC patients treated with >=5/6 BCG induction instillations were retrospectively included. RNA-sequencing (50 million paired-end reads, >=80\% tumor) was performed on centrally reviewed tumors from: 1) BCG-na{\"\i}ve tumors and recurrent tumors from patients that failed BCG therapy (BCG non-responders), matched to an equal number of 2) patients who had an ongoing complete response until study inclusion (BCG responders). Endpoints were HG recurrence-free survival defined as BCG-failure (RFS) and progression-free survival (PFS), assessed by survival analyses. BCG-failure was defined as development of a biopsy-proven HG recurrence or progression to muscle-muscle invasion. Using RNA-seq, we sought to identify genes, pathways and signatures that stratified patients with respect to these endpoints. 132 BCG-na{\"\i}ve T1HG tumors were sequenced and 45 post-BCG tumors. Median follow-up for all patients was 75 months (IQR 48-106), 99 months for n=63 BCG-responders (IQR 74-120) and 49 months for n=69 BCG-non-responders (IQR 25-79). Three molecular subtypes were identified: BCG1 (32\%), BCG2 (40\%) and BCG3 (28\%). BCG3 patients had a significantly worse RFS (HR 2.4 p\&lt;0.01) and PFS (HR 2.7; p\&lt;0.01) compared to BCG1 or BCG2 patients. BCG3 tumors expressed high EMT and basal markers and had an immune suppressive tumor microenvironment. Immune deconvolution revealed significantly increased immune cell infiltration (i.e. B cells, T regulatory cells and tumor associated macrophages), while CD14 and FOXP3 were identified as significant regulons in BCG3 patients. BCG1 patients showed a favorable PFS and overexpression of genes associated with BCG processing and antigen presentation. BCG2 patients overexpressed luminal BC markers, such as FGFR3, showed MYC pathway activity and were mostly luminal papillary (consensus muscle-invasive BC classifier). Interestingly, post-BCG tumor recurrences were strongly enriched for the BCG3 subtype; 30/45 (67\%) of recurring tumors were classified as BCG3. Gene expression profiling of BCG-na{\"\i}ve primary T1HG BC patients identified three molecular subtypes that corresponded to clinical outcome and response to BCG therapy. The EMT-basal/immune suppressive BCG3 patients are not candidates for treatment with BCG given the poor RFS and PFS and might be candidates for early radical cystectomy or immune-modulating therapy.Citation Format: Florus C.

Unfortunately, risk stratification is insufficient to identify patients at risk of BCG treatment failure. Another challenge is the worldwide BCG-shortage, which emphasizes the need for alternative therapeutic strategies. Thus, we aimed to investigate molecular signal transduction pathway activities using Philips{\textquoteright} OncoSignal consumer-ready test in BCG treated T1HG BC in order to identify differentially expressed pathways that may predict clinical outcome or provide a rationale for alternative therapeutic strategies. Primary T1HG BC patients treated with >=5/6 BCG induction instillations were retrospectively included. RNA-sequencing (50 million paired-end reads, containing >=80\% tumor) was performed on: 1) BCG-na{\"\i}ve tumors from patients with complete response to BCG at study inclusion (BCG-responders) and 2) BCG-na{\"\i}ve tumors with matching muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) recurrences during BCG therapy (BCG-failures). Philips OncoSignal analysis was performed to quantify functional signal transduction pathway activities. Molecular subtyping was performed using non-muscle invasive and muscle-invasive classifiers. Clinical and molecular subtyping results were combined with Philips OncoSignal to explore differences between BCG responders and BCG failures and between molecular subtypes. OncoSignal was performed in 20 tumors: 14 BCG-na{\"\i}ve (7 BCG-responders vs 7 BCG-failures) and 6 MIBC recurrences. Median follow-up for BCG-responders was 99 months (IQR 74-120); median follow-up for BCG-failures was 49 months (IQR 25-79), with a median time to progression of 14 months (IQR 10-41). Based on pilot data, MAPK and TGFβ pathway activity was significantly higher in tumors from BCG failures vs BCG-responders (both p\&lt;0.05). Using TCGAs MIBC classifier, 10/14 pre-BCG samples were luminal-papillary (LumP), 1/14 was luminal-infiltrated (lum-inf) and 3/14 basal-squamous (bas-sq). In post-BCG MIBC, 2/6 tumors were lum-inf, 3/6 bas-sq and 1/6 neuronal. Using Erasmus MCs T1-BCG classifier (unpublished), 7/14 pre-BCG tumors were luminal-like, the other 7/14 were lum-inf/basal-like. All 6 post-BCG MIBCs were lum-inf/basal-like. Importantly, TCGAs bas-sq/lum-inf subtype and Erasmus MCs lum-inf/basal-like subtype had the highest MAPK, TGFβ and JAK-STAT1/2 activity (all p\&lt;0.05). Based on our pilot study, results indicate that Philips OncoSignal is able to stratify BCG failures from BCG responders. Furthermore, OncoSignal results discern LumP tumors from lum-inf/basal-like tumors. Philips OncoSignal might be useful to stratify patients for alternative treatments. Further investigation on a large cohort of BC patients is required to determine whether Philips OncoSignal can be of value during clinical-decision making.Citation Format: Florus C. De Jong, Teemu D.

This combination is preferred due to its favorable toxicity profile. Approximately 25\% of NAC treated patients will experience complete pathological response (pT0) at time of radical cystectomy (RC). NAC-treated patients with residual disease at RC have poorer prognosis compared to those who achieved pT0. Here we systematically defined the in vitro functional determinants of resistance to gemcitabine and cisplatin in bladder cancer. To accomplish this, we performed molecular profiling and functional genomic screening on a panel of bladder cancer cell lines (KU-19-19, T24, TCCSUP, 253J and 5637), each having the parental cell line with matched gemcitabine-, cisplatin-, and dual GC-resistant derivatives. We performed whole exome sequencing, RNA sequencing, and phospho-proteomic profiling on these 20 cell lines. To identify chemogenetic interactions that govern sensitivity or resistance to these agents, we performed whole genome CRISPR knockout screening in the GC-resistant cells both in the presence and absence of GC. We identified several novel genes that when inactivated are capable of sensitizing GC resistant cell lines to the two agents. The majority of shared chemosensitizing genes fall into several DNA damage response pathways. This is consistent with the established mechanism of action of GC chemotherapy and observations that have been made from clinical cohorts, where loss-of-function mutations in these pathways correlate with response to platinum-based chemotherapy. Notably, our work has identified several druggable candidates that could serve as potential targets for enhancing responses rates to GC. Interestingly, comparing these candidate genes and pathways with those differentially expressed in the RNA sequencing and proteomic profiling showed limited overlap. This work provides a comprehensive view of the functional determinants of GC sensitivity in bladder cancer. In support of and expanding on previous studies, we identified additional DNA damage response genes that when lost enhance sensitivity to GC. These genes should be further explored for their utility as predictive biomarkers of response to GC-based therapy in clinical cohorts. Importantly, a number of these could be targeted in combination with GC-based NAC to potentially improve response.Citation Format: Robert T. Jones, Tahlita C.

One of the two most commonly utilized chemotherapy regimens for MIBC consists of combination therapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC). Importantly, cisplatin-based chemotherapy leads to complete response (pT0) in approximately 25\% of patients, while the remaining 75\% are left with residual disease. For MIBC patients, the presence of residual disease at cystectomy is associated with significantly poorer prognosis. Previous efforts to screen tumor-derived specimens have identified a number of mutational biomarkers associated with NAC response; however, to date these efforts have been limited by the number of patients profiled and the molecular and mutational heterogeneity intrinsic to bladder cancers. Moreover, these efforts have primarily relied on a single technology (e.g., whole-exome sequencing or transcriptome profiling), and were not designed to look at GC-resistance patterns in a way that integrates these data types. Therefore, we sought to systematically define the molecular phenotypes associated with chemoresistant bladder cancer cells, and to functionally interrogate these features to better define essential genes and pathways that govern chemoresponsiveness. To accomplish this, we have extensively characterized a panel of six bladder cancer cell lines (KU-19-19, T24, TCCSUP, 253J, 5637, and RT112), each of which has three derivative cell lines with acquired resistance to gemcitabine, cisplatin, and GC combination. For all of these cell lines we have performed whole-transcriptome mRNA sequencing, whole-exome sequencing, and reverse phase protein microarray. Additionally, we have performed functional genomic screening using whole-genome CRISPR knockout libraries, in the combination GC-resistant derivative cell lines. Using these data we identified multiple important chemoresistance genes and pathways, both previously known and novel. Interestingly, even though we found heterogeneous expression patterns seen across different {\textendash}omic platforms, the functional genomic screens in GC-resistant cell lines converged on many genes and pathways that are essential to DNA damage response. These data suggest that functional genomic screens are perhaps more likely to identify genes and pathways that are directly linked to each of these drugs{\textquoteright} specific mechanisms of action, as opposed to context-specific molecular differences seen across cell lines. Importantly, these results could enable improved prediction and personalization of therapy through identifying biomarkers that predict chemosensitivity and resistance. This study also suggests that identifying more generalizable strategies to overcome chemoresistance could increase the number of bladder cancer patients experiencing deeper and more complete responses to these common chemotherapeutic drugs.Citation Format: Robert T.

	abstract = {Proceedings: AACR Annual Meeting 2017; April 1-5, 2017; Washington, DCDespite the pivotal role of phosphatases in cancer cell signalling, systemic understanding of phosphatase targets is still at infancy. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a human tumor suppressor complex. PP2A inhibition is a requirement for human cell transformation and PP2A regulates many cancer critical signalling pathways. Importantly, emerging data indicates that reactivation of PP2A tumor suppressor activity could provide entirely novel approach for cancer therapy. Here, we present first systemic analysis of phosphoprotein targets (dephosphorylome) regulated by PP2A in cancer cells. Based on data, PP2A regulates cancer critical signalling pathways, including entire EGFR-RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK cascade, and functions as a master regulator of MYC function. At network level, PP2A targets critical cellular processes such as chromosome organization, RNA splicing, and nuclear envelope assembly. Surprisingly, soft clustering of PP2A dephosphorylome revealed that most phospho-target residues are subject to only unidirectional regulation in cancer cells. Moreover, targets show intracellular gradient where phosphatase inhibition dominates nuclear phosphorylation balance. Since phosphoregulation is critical for cancer drug responses, dephosphorylome was correlated with cancer cell responses to over 300 drugs. Importantly, cancer therapies could be broadly classified based on their dephosphorylome, both at quantitative and qualitative manner. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of this large dataset by validating the role of PP2A in MEK inhibitor resistance in KRAS mutant cancer cells via regulation of RAF, mTor and MYC. The study presents first systemic resource to understand potential of PP2A manipulation in cancer cell signalling and drug responses. The study also uncovers generally important insights to phosphoregulation.Citation Format: Otto Kauko, Susumu Imanishi, Evgeny Kulesskiy, Teemu D.

Consequently, PP2A is an antagonist of multiple oncogenic pathways and PP2A reactivation may provide an alternative route to target these pathways. Importantly, because PP2A reactivation would result in simultaneous dephosphorylation of both collateral and downstream effectors of kinase pathways, it might circumvent commonly encountered kinase inhibitor resistance mechanisms.To systematically study the role of PP2A in cancer therapy response we used RNAi targeting against PP2A inhibitor proteins CIP2A, PME-1 and SET (PP2A reactivation), and PP2A structural subunits (PP2A inhibition), together with high throughput drug sensitivity screen covering 300 clinical cancer drugs and investigational compounds. Changes in phosphorylation status of PP2A targets in response to RNAi perturbation, was studied by LC-MS/MS-based label-free quantitative phosphoproteomics analysis. Importantly, we show that cancer cell drug sensitivity across 300 compounds correlates with PP2A activity profile so that PP2A inhibition made cells on average resistant to therapies, whereas their sensitization by PP2A inhibitor protein siRNAs correlated with changes in phosphoprotein regulation. In particular, cancer cell response to kinase inhibitors followed very closely PP2A activity regulation and PP2A reactivation resulted in increased average sensitivity to 105 kinase inhibitors. Furthermore, we show that PP2A reactivation results in convergent phosphorylation patterns with targeting of kinase pathways by RAS inhibition. We also identify novel PP2A regulated phosphorylation sites in target proteins of these kinases. As a validation study, we demonstrate that PP2A inhibitor protein PME-1 mediates resistance of glioma cells to various types of survival pathway kinase inhibitors, as well as to temozolomide. Co-treatment with PME-1 siRNA and kinase inhibitors eradicates several GBM cell lines, and glioma stem cells, in vitro, and this combination strategy shows pronounced efficacy also in in vivo models. The PME-1-elicited resistance mechanism is mediated by reactivation of specific PP2A complexes and involves regulation of PP2A target HDAC4.Together our data combines 4500 drug response profiles, and more than 5000 quantitative phosphopeptide idenitifications to draw first systemic map of relevance of PP2A biology in cancer therapy responses. In particular the data reveals an unprecedented importance of PP2A activity for kinase inhibitor responses. Based on these data we propose that in order to efficiently inhibit phosphorylation-dependent signaling in cancer cells, and thus provide better therapeutic index for the kinase inhibitors, they should be combined with emerging small molecule PP2A reactivating compounds.Citation Format: Otto Kauko, Susumu Imanishi, Amanpreet Kaur, Daniel Laajala, Evgeny Kulesskiy, Mikael Jumppanen, Garry Corthals, Tero Aittokallio, Krister Wennerberg, Jukka Westermarck.
